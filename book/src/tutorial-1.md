# Add `bindgen` as a Build Dependency

First we need to declare a build-time dependency on `bindgen` by adding it to
the `[build-dependencies]` section of our crate's `Cargo.toml` file.

Please always use the latest version of `bindgen`, it has the most fixes and
best compatibility. At the time of writing the latest bindgen is `0.51.1`, but
you can always check [the bindgen page of
crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/bindgen) to verify the latest version if
you're unsure.

```toml
[build-dependencies]
bindgen = "0.51.1"
```
